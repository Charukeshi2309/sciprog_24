In this practical, I built upon my previous work by developing additional program components that integrate concepts from last week’s practical with topics covered in this week’s lectures. The main objective was to calculate tangent values for angles measured in degrees and determine the area under the curve of 
tan(x) from 0 to 60 degrees using the Trapezoidal Rule.
